## Linked List

This is a simple coding exercise to better understand linked lists and how they work. Inspired by Udacity's Data Structures & Algorithms nano degree course, I decided to try writing a `Node` class in the each of these languages: Ruby, JavaScript, Elixir and Python.

Surprisingly, I enjoy the slight nuances in each language's implementation, but the Elixir pattern matching makes for some very nice clean code.
