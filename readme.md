## Linked List

This is a simple coding exercise to better understand linked lists and how they work. Inspired by the [Udacity - Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256) Nanodegree course, I decided to try writing a `Node` class in the each of these languages: Ruby, JavaScript, Elixir and Python.

Surprisingly, I enjoy the slight nuances in each language's implementation, but the Elixir pattern matching makes for some very nice clean code.

You can run each of these in console, provided you have Python, Ruby, Node and Elixir/Erlang on your machine. If not, I'm sure a repl exists online. Clone this repo and try the following:

```bash
python linked-list.py
  ruby linked-list.rb
  node linked-list.js
elixir linked-list.ex
```
